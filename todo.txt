- look around opencv's python           tutorial(http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html) for video editing taking about a day or two.
figure out if we can use it for instant edits to the video.

- Go through opencv support(if any!) for embedding video in a tkinter GUI implementation.

Please add/modify as appropriate.
